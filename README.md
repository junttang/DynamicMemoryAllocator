# DynamicMemoryAllocator

- **Introduction**

SP-Project 3   -   'Dynamic Memory Allocator' Program

(commonly known as malloc-lab project from CMU, and I got 97/100 score)

<br>

- **Summary**

This Project is implementing the Dynamic Memory Allocator such as malloc in libc. I developed this program based on a deep understanding of Dynamic Memory Allocation, Implicit & Explicit & Segregated Free List, Peak Memory Utilization, Speedup, etc. More details are on the Document file attached.

<br>

- **Requirements**

To execute this program successfully, you need to generate an account on CSPRO server('sftp://cspro.sogang.ac.kr') because this program is suitable to run on ssh shell on CSPRO. Of course, you can run this program on almost all version of ssh shell, not only on CSPRO.

<br>

- **Installation**

Just download all the attached files and assemble these into a one file. After this, compile with 'make' command, and run 'mdriver' program with some options. Enjoy my development!

<br>

- **Troubleshooting**

If you have any problem, please read the attached PDF file, or directly contact me via github or email.
